//! A thread pool for isolating blocking I/O in async programs.
//!
//! Sometimes there's no way to avoid blocking I/O. Consider files or stdin, which have weak async
//! support on modern operating systems. While [IOCP], [AIO], and [io_uring] are possible
//! solutions, they're not always available or ideal.
//!
//! Since blocking is not allowed inside futures, we must move blocking I/O onto a special thread
//! pool provided by this crate. The pool dynamically spawns and stops threads depending on the
//! current number of running I/O jobs.
//!
//! Note that there is a limit on the number of active threads. Once that limit is hit, a running
//! job has to finish before others get a chance to run. When a thread is idle, it waits for the
//! next job or shuts down after a certain timeout.
//!
//! The default number of threads (set to 500) can be altered by setting BLOCKING_MAX_THREADS environment
//! variable with value between 1 and 10000.

//! # Examples
//!
//! Read the contents of a file:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use blocking::unblock;
//! use std::fs;
//!
//! # futures_lite::future::block_on(async {
//! let contents = unblock(|| fs::read_to_string("file.txt")).await?;
//! println!("{}", contents);
//! # std::io::Result::Ok(()) });
//! ```
//!
//! Read a file and pipe its contents to stdout:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use blocking::{unblock, Unblock};
//! use futures_lite::io;
//! use std::fs::File;
//!
//! # futures_lite::future::block_on(async {
//! let input = unblock(|| File::open("file.txt")).await?;
//! let input = Unblock::new(input);
//! let mut output = Unblock::new(std::io::stdout());
//!
//! io::copy(input, &mut output).await?;
//! # std::io::Result::Ok(()) });
//! ```
//!
//! Iterate over the contents of a directory:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use blocking::Unblock;
//! use futures_lite::prelude::*;
//! use std::fs;
//!
//! # futures_lite::future::block_on(async {
//! let mut dir = Unblock::new(fs::read_dir(".")?);
//! while let Some(item) = dir.next().await {
//!     println!("{}", item?.file_name().to_string_lossy());
//! }
//! # std::io::Result::Ok(()) });
//! ```
//!
//! Spawn a process:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use blocking::unblock;
//! use std::process::Command;
//!
//! # futures_lite::future::block_on(async {
//! let out = unblock(|| Command::new("dir").output()).await?;
//! # std::io::Result::Ok(()) });
//! ```

///
/// This type implements traits [`Stream`], [`AsyncRead`], [`AsyncWrite`], or [`AsyncSeek`] if the
/// inner type implements [`Iterator`], [`Read`], [`Write`], or [`Seek`], respectively.
///
/// # Caveats
///
/// [`Unblock`] is a low-level primitive, and as such it comes with some caveats.
///
/// For higher-level primitives built on top of [`Unblock`], look into [`async-fs`] or
/// [`async-process`] (on Windows).
///
/// [`async-fs`]: https://github.com/smol-rs/async-fs
/// [`async-process`]: https://github.com/smol-rs/async-process
///
/// [`Unblock`] communicates with I/O operations on the thread pool through a pipe. That means an
/// async read/write operation simply receives/sends some bytes from/into the pipe. When in reading
/// mode, the thread pool reads bytes from the I/O handle and forwards them into the pipe until it
/// becomes full. When in writing mode, the thread pool reads bytes from the pipe and forwards them
/// into the I/O handle.
///
/// Use [`Unblock::with_capacity()`] to configure the capacity of the pipe.
///
/// ### Reading
///
/// If you create an [`Unblock`]`<`[`Stdin`][`std::io::Stdin`]`>`, read some bytes from it,
/// and then drop it, a blocked read operation may keep hanging on the thread pool. The next
/// attempt to read from stdin will lose bytes read by the hanging operation. This is a difficult
/// problem to solve, so make sure you only use a single stdin handle for the duration of the
/// entire program.
///
/// ### Writing
///
/// If writing data through the [`AsyncWrite`] trait, make sure to flush before dropping the
/// [`Unblock`] handle or some buffered data might get lost.
///
/// ### Seeking
///
/// Because of buffering in the pipe, if [`Unblock`] wraps a [`File`][`std::fs::File`], a single
/// read operation may move the file cursor farther than is the span of the operation. In fact,
/// reading just keeps going in the background until the pipe gets full. Keep this mind when
/// using [`AsyncSeek`] with [relative][`SeekFrom::Current`] offsets.
///
